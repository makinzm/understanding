# 1. Introduction

There is a foundation model which is called Transformer. However, it has quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length.

In 2022, structured state space sequence models (S4) have been proposed, which is combination of RNNs and CNNs, and it can handle long-range dependencies in sequences with linear complexity.

Here, the authors propose a new class of selective state space models.
