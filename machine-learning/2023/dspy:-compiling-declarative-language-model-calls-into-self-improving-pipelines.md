# 1. Introduction

LMs (Language Models) performance depends on prompt quality for each task.

Prompt tuning is implemented interactively widely but is inefficient and not reusable.

More systematic approaches are needed to optimize prompts and compose LM calls, so we propose DSPy.

- DSPy programming model: A framework that replaces manual prompt engineering with modular, declarative components that can be composed like neural network layers to build LM pipelines.
- DSPy compiler: An optimizer that automatically generates effective prompts and fine-tuning strategies for DSPy modules by bootstrapping examples from training data and a validation metric.
