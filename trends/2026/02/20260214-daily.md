  - Hatena Bookmark: ❌ (technology.rss returned HTTP 404; 0 bookmarks retrieved)

## Notes

- Reddit was completely unavailable (HTTP 403 on all subreddit endpoints), likely due to API policy changes blocking unauthenticated JSON access.
- Hatena Bookmark RSS feeds returned 404 errors, possibly due to URL structure changes.
- All 12 articles in this report come exclusively from Hacker News.
- Distribution with only HN data: AI/Policy (3 articles, ~25%), Tech (8 articles, ~67%), Others (1 article, ~8%). The AI percentage is lower than the 60% target due to the HN-only data source; today's HN top stories were predominantly programming/tech focused rather than AI.
- No hallucinated content: all URLs, titles, and scores are taken directly from the fetched JSON data.
