## Collection Summary

- **Total Articles Analyzed**: 21
- **Sources Checked**:
  - Hacker News: ✅ (21 stories fetched at 2026-02-13T21:18:24Z)
  - Reddit: ❌ (All 11 subreddits returned HTTP 403 - blocked, 0 posts fetched)
  - Hatena Bookmark: ⚠️ (RSS feeds partially fetched, 0 bookmarks parsed - `technology.rss` returned 404)
- **Compliance Status**: All rate limits respected, robots.txt followed. Reddit block is on Reddit's side (authentication now required for JSON API).

## Notes

- **Reddit blocked**: All 11 subreddits returned HTTP 403. Reddit appears to have tightened access restrictions on its public JSON API, likely requiring OAuth authentication even for public posts. The fetch script will need updating to use the Reddit OAuth API with registered app credentials.
- **Hatena 0 results**: The `it.rss` and `all.rss` feeds loaded but yielded 0 bookmarks. The `technology.rss` feed returned HTTP 404. RSS parsing logic in the script may need adjustment for the current Hatena feed format.
- **Data source**: All 21 articles are exclusively from Hacker News. Categories and ratings are based on article content and HN score thresholds (200+ = ★★★, 100–199 = ★★, 50–99 = ★).
- **AI weighting note**: With 21 HN-only articles, AI/agent-related content is naturally prominent today (Gemini 3, GPT-5.3, GPT-5.2, AI agent journalism, Clearview AI, IronClaw, RentAHuman = 7 items = ~44%). Tech items account for ~37%, and World/Others ~19%.
