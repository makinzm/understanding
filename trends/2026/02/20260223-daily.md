# Daily AI & Tech Trends - 2026-02-23

## Pick Up

1. [Would You Click 'Accept'? Automatically detecting malicious Azure OAuth applications using LLMs](https://www.wiz.io/blog/detecting-malicious-oauth-applications)
   - Why I recommend: Directly applies LLMs to a concrete security detection problem — using language models to classify OAuth permission scopes as benign or malicious. Highly actionable for ML engineers interested in security applications of transformers.

2. [Building an Agentic Cloud Security Ecosystem: A Reference Architecture with Wiz MCP and Infosys Cyber Next](https://www.wiz.io/blog/infosys-mcp)
   - Why I recommend: Describes a real-world agentic architecture using MCP (Model Context Protocol) for cloud security automation. Useful reference for anyone building multi-agent pipelines that need to interact with cloud infrastructure APIs.

3. [Show HN: AI Timeline – 171 LLMs from Transformer (2017) to GPT-5.3 (2026)](https://llm-timeline.com/)
   - Why I recommend: A comprehensive visual timeline of 171 LLMs — a quick-reference resource for understanding the lineage and evolution of models, useful when contextualizing new papers or benchmarks.

4. [Ladybird adopts Rust](https://ladybird.org/posts/adopting-rust/)
   - Why I recommend: A major independent browser engine choosing Rust signals growing industry confidence in Rust for safety-critical systems. HN discussion (504 comments) is particularly rich on memory safety trade-offs vs. C++.

5. [ASML unveils EUV light source advance that could yield 50% more chips by 2030](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/asml-unveils-euv-light-source-advance-that-could-yield-50-more-chips-by-2030-2026-02-23/)
   - Why I recommend: Hardware substrate matters for ML — a 50% increase in chip yield by 2030 would directly affect GPU supply and training cost trajectories. Relevant for anyone planning long-horizon compute budgets.

6. [Sub-$200 Lidar could reshuffle auto sensor economics](https://spectrum.ieee.org/solid-state-lidar-microvision-adas)
   - Why I recommend: Cheap, high-quality LiDAR would unlock large-scale 3D data collection for autonomous driving and robotics ML. Worth tracking as it may open new dataset and fine-tuning opportunities.

7. [The Age Verification Trap: Verifying age undermines everyone's data protection](https://spectrum.ieee.org/age-verification)
   - Why I recommend: Highest-engagement privacy story of the day (971 points, 777 comments). Age verification systems often demand biometric or document data — understanding the privacy implications matters for any ML engineer building identity-adjacent systems.

8. [From Detection to Remediation: It's Time to Rethink AppSec Around Exploitability and Root Cause Fixes](https://www.wiz.io/blog/from-detection-to-remediation-it-s-time-to-rethink-appsec-around-exploitability-a)
   - Why I recommend: Argues for a shift from detection-heavy to remediation-first AppSec. Useful framing for ML engineers who build pipelines deployed in cloud environments and need to prioritize security findings.

### Notes

- **Reddit**: All 11 subreddits returned HTTP 403 Blocked. This environment does not have access to Reddit's JSON API (likely IP-based blocking of the runner environment).
- **Hatena**: RSS feed at `https://b.hatena.ne.jp/hotentry/it` returned a malformed XML error (`not well-formed (invalid token): line 19, column 48`). Skipped per compliance policy.
- **Wiz Blog**: RSS feed returned 544 entries spanning 2020–2026. Only the 6 articles from the past 7 days are displayed in the table above. Some titles appear to have their first character truncated (RSS feed data quality issue).
- **arXiv cs.LG**: Fetched 0 papers. The 15-second crawl-delay is respected but parsing may have failed silently. No articles available to report.
- **HN "AI Timeline"**: The submitted URL references "GPT-5.3 (2026)" in the page title — this is a user-submitted HN post title, not validated content. Included as-is from the fetched data.
