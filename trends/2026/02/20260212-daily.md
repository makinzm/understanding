## Collection Summary

- **Total Articles Analyzed**: 18
- **Sources Checked**:
  - Hacker News: ✅ (18 stories fetched at 2026-02-12T21:16:15Z)
  - Reddit: ❌ (All 11 subreddits returned HTTP 403 Blocked — likely due to missing Reddit username in User-Agent per compliance-notes.md)
  - Hatena Bookmark: ❌ (technology.rss returned HTTP 404; it.rss and all.rss returned 0 parseable items)
- **Compliance Status**: Rate limits respected; Reddit blocked (not a rate limit issue — 403 Forbidden); Hatena RSS feeds inaccessible

## Notes

- **Reddit 403 issue**: All subreddits are blocked. The compliance-notes.md flags a `YOUR_REDDIT_USERNAME` placeholder in the User-Agent string that was never replaced — this likely triggers Reddit's bot detection. Recommend updating `scripts/fetch_trends.py` with a valid User-Agent.
- **Hatena RSS issue**: The `technology.rss` feed URL returns 404 (endpoint removed). The `it.rss` and `all.rss` feeds were fetched but yielded 0 results — the RSS parsing logic in the script may need updating for the current feed format.
- **HN-only report**: This report is based solely on Hacker News data (18 articles). The distribution skews AI-heavy (~67% AI, ~22% Tech, ~11% Others) which aligns with the 60/30/10 weighting goal given the available data.
- **Excluded items**: "The Crown of Nobles Noble Gas Tube Display (2024)" and "Shut Up: Comment Blocker" were lower-priority items not fitting the AI/Tech/World focus categories at meaningful depth.
