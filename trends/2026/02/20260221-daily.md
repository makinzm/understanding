## Notes

- **Reddit blocked**: All 11 subreddits (MachineLearning, LocalLLaMA, OpenAI, ClaudeAI, AutoGPT, programming, SideProject, opensource, webdev, worldnews, japan) returned HTTP 403. This is a known issue with Reddit's API blocking non-OAuth public access. No Reddit data is included.
- **Hatena partially blocked**: `technology.rss` returned 404 (feed may have been moved or renamed). `it.rss` and `all.rss` returned XML that parsed to 0 items — the RSS structure may have changed. No Hatena data is included.
- **HN-only day**: All 19 articles are from Hacker News. Category distribution reflects HN's audience rather than the 60/30/10 AI/Tech/Others target. Actual distribution: AI ≈ 32% (6 articles), Tech ≈ 42% (8 articles), World ≈ 26% (5 articles).
- **Notable engagement anomaly**: "Keep Android Open" (F-Droid) has 1,945 points and 663 comments — by far the most-engaged story. "Claws" (Karpathy) has only 113 points but 513 comments, suggesting a highly active discussion disproportionate to its score.
