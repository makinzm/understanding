## Collection Summary

- **Total Articles Analyzed**: 15
- **Sources Checked**:
  - Hacker News: ✅ (15 stories fetched at 2026-02-22T21:14:01Z)
  - Reddit: ❌ (0 posts — all subreddits returned HTTP 403 Blocked)
  - Hatena Bookmark: ❌ (0 bookmarks — RSS parsing returned 0 items; `technology.rss` returned HTTP 404)
- **Compliance Status**: All rate limits respected, robots.txt followed

## Notes

- **Reddit unavailable**: All 11 subreddits (r/MachineLearning, r/LocalLLaMA, r/OpenAI, r/ClaudeAI, r/AutoGPT, r/programming, r/SideProject, r/opensource, r/webdev, r/worldnews, r/japan) returned HTTP 403 Blocked. Reddit may have tightened API access restrictions.
- **Hatena Bookmark unavailable**: The `technology.rss` feed returned HTTP 404. The `it.rss` and `all.rss` feeds responded successfully but the script's XML parser yielded 0 items — likely due to RSS 1.0 (RDF) namespace handling in the fetch script.
- **AI weighting**: With only 15 HN articles, achieving exact 60/30/10 distribution is limited. 3 articles are clearly AI-focused (20% of total), 8 are tech (53%), and 4 are world/general (27%). This reflects the actual HN front page composition on this date rather than a data gap.
- **Data integrity**: All 15 articles are sourced exclusively from `/tmp/trends-data.json` (HackerNews section). No content has been invented or hallucinated.
